# Jade Empire Trainer 

Open the trainer once you're in a game. Provides the following features:

- Adds 1,000 style points on startup
- Change your alignment modifier in config.ini
- Infinite chi
- Infinite focus

## Config

Inside the directory you'll see a `config.ini`. At the moment the only setting working is `Alignment`. You can change this to *Bad*, *Good*, *Neutral*, or *None* if you want it to skip and leave your alignment alone.

Note: Things are a bit clunky right now. I'll be updating soon to make it better.
